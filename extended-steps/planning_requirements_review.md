## Step: Planning / Requirements Review

**Description**  
Review and validate all functional and non-functional requirements before development begins. Ensure that performance, security, and scalability considerations are defined alongside the functional scope. Establish quality objectives, identify project risks, assign risk owners, and define mitigation plans.

### Inputs
- **Requirements Document**
  - Functional requirements documented and approved *(REQ-01)*
  - Acceptance criteria defined for each user story *(REQ-03)*
- **Non-Functional Requirements Specification**
  - Performance, security, and scalability requirements defined *(REQ-02)*
- **Risk Register**
  - Risks and dependencies identified *(REQ-04)*
- **Project Charter** (from Step B1) *(BUS-01)*
- **Scope Statement** (from Step B2) *(PM-05)*

---

### Output
- Approved requirements document (functional) *(REQ-01)*
- Approved NFR specification (performance, security, scalability) *(REQ-02)*
- User stories with acceptance criteria *(REQ-03)*
- Risk register with identified dependencies *(REQ-04)*
- Risk register with assigned owners and mitigation plans *(PM-13, PM-14, PM-15)*
- Risk review schedule *(PM-16)*
- Quality plan with defined quality objectives *(PM-21)*

---

### Governance
- Functional requirements reviewed and signed off *(REQ-01)*
- Non-functional requirements reviewed by Architect *(REQ-02)*
- Acceptance criteria validated per user story *(REQ-03)*
