**Description**  
Establish the business foundation for the project by defining objectives, aligning with organizational strategy, assessing criticality and impact, and setting up the governance structure. This step also establishes the DORA-required ICT risk management framework by defining the SDLC strategy, secure coding guidelines, roles and responsibilities, and access controls.
