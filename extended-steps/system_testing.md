## Step: System Testing

**Description**  
Conduct comprehensive system-level testing to validate that the integrated system meets all functional and non-functional requirements before it is cleared for release.

---

### Inputs
- **Merged Code** on target branch
- **Test Strategy Document** *(REQ-14)*
- **Test Cases** derived from requirements and acceptance criteria *(REQ-15)*
- **Non-Functional Requirements** (performance, security, scalability) *(REQ-02)*

---

### Output
- System test report (signed off) *(REQ-17)*
- Regression test report *(REQ-18)*
- Defects logged, tracked, and prioritized *(REQ-19)*

---

### Governance
- Test strategy documented and approved *(REQ-14)*
- Test cases traceable to requirements *(REQ-15)*
- System testing completed before release *(REQ-17)*
- Regression tests executed for every release *(REQ-18)*
- All defects logged and prioritized *(REQ-19)*

---

### Requirements Traceability
REQ-02, REQ-14, REQ-15, REQ-17, REQ-18, REQ-19
