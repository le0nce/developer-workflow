## Step: System Testing

**Description**  
Conduct comprehensive system-level testing to validate that the integrated system meets all functional and non-functional requirements before it is cleared for release.

---

### Inputs
- **Merged Code** on target branch
- **Test Strategy Document** *(REQ-14)*
- **Test Cases** derived from requirements and acceptance criteria *(REQ-15)*
- **Non-Functional Requirements** (performance, security, scalability) *(REQ-02)*
- **Acceptance Criteria** (from Quality Plan) *(PM-22)*

---

### Output
- System test report (signed off) *(REQ-17)*
- Regression test report *(REQ-18)*
- Defects logged, tracked, and prioritized *(REQ-19)*
- Acceptance sign-off record *(PM-22)*
- Formal milestone acceptance record *(PM-23)*
- Regression test evidence *(TEST-04)*
- SAST/DAST security test results *(TEST-05)*
- End-to-end traceability matrix *(AUD-02)*
- Test evidence archived per retention policy *(AUD-03)*

---

### Governance
- Test strategy documented and approved *(REQ-14)*
- Test cases traceable to requirements *(REQ-15)*
- System testing completed before release *(REQ-17)*
- Regression tests executed for every release *(REQ-18)*
- All defects logged and prioritized *(REQ-19)*
- Acceptance and sign-off criteria validated against system test results *(PM-22)*
- Formal acceptance is required at this milestone before release clearance *(PM-23)*
- Functional test cases mapped to business requirements *(TEST-03)*
- Regression tests executed before every release *(TEST-04)*
- SAST and DAST security testing performed *(TEST-05)*
- End-to-end traceability from requirement to deployment verified *(AUD-02)*
- Test evidence retained according to policy *(AUD-03)*
