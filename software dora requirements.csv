Testing,Integration Testing,TEST-02,Integration tests executed in CI pipeline,QA Lead,Integration test reports,Yes,"Ensures systems work together reliably, reducing risk of production incidents."
Testing,Functional Testing,TEST-03,Functional test cases mapped to business requirements,QA Lead,Test case management tool,No,"DORA requires ICT systems to support critical business functions reliably."
Testing,Regression Testing,TEST-04,Regression tests executed before every release,QA Lead,Regression reports,Yes,"Prevents reintroduction of known issues, supporting operational continuity."
Testing,Security Testing,TEST-05,SAST and DAST security testing performed,Security/QA,Security test reports,Yes,"Explicitly supports DORA requirements for ICT security and threat prevention."

Merge Request,Code Review,MR-01,At least one peer review required for every merge request,Reviewer,Merge request approval record,No,"DORA requires strong change governance and oversight of ICT changes."
Merge Request,Code Review,MR-02,Automated quality checks must pass before merge,DevOps,CI status checks,Yes,"Ensures only compliant and tested changes are introduced into ICT systems."
Merge Request,Code Review,MR-03,Protected branches prevent direct commits,DevOps,Branch protection configuration,Yes,"Supports controlled change management as required by DORA."

Release Management,Release,REL-01,Formal release approval required,Release Manager,Release approval record,No,"DORA requires governance oversight for significant ICT changes."
Release Management,Release,REL-02,Release notes generated and retained,Release Manager,Release notes,Yes,"Ensures traceability and transparency of ICT changes for audit and incident analysis."
Release Management,Release,REL-03,Rollback strategy documented and tested,DevOps,Rollback plan,No,"DORA requires effective ICT response and recovery capabilities."
