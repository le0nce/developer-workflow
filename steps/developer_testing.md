## Step: Developer Testing

**Description**  
Execute developer-level testing to verify that the implemented code meets the requirements and acceptance criteria. This includes integration testing using test containers and browser-based testing via MCP.

---

### Inputs
- **MCP Browser** (used by AI for automated testing)
- **Test Containers** for proper integration testing
- **Agent.md** (test rules that cannot be changed)
- **Integration Test Cases**
  - Must reference exact ticket/requirement/scenarios *(REQ-15)*
- **Acceptance Criteria** (from Quality Plan) *(PM-22)*

---

### Output
- Test results (passed/failed)
- Integration test evidence *(REQ-16)*
- Test cases traceable to requirements *(REQ-15)*
- Acceptance criteria validation results *(PM-22)*
- Functional test evidence mapped to business requirements *(TEST-03)*

---

### Governance
- Test strategy documented *(REQ-14)*
- Test cases derived from requirements and acceptance criteria *(REQ-15)*
- Integration tests executed *(REQ-16)*
- Code review of test quality *(REQ-21)*
- Acceptance and sign-off criteria validated against test results *(PM-22)*
- Functional test cases mapped to business requirements *(TEST-03)*

---

### Requirements Traceability
REQ-14, REQ-15, REQ-16, REQ-21, PM-22, TEST-03
